# Portfolio of Work by Tom Bignall
This app is a portfolio of my work as a developer, built with Node JS and Express. You can view all of my recent projects and access a live demo and github files. This app handles errors in a friendly way, as well as redirecting visitors in the right direction.

## Motivation
This project was built as a place to store all the work I would like to show others in a simple way.

## Build Status
The project template is built, however there will continously be projects added to this site

## Code Style
Node JS

## Features
* This page has a home, about and error pages
* Project pages are created from Node JS routes and dynamically display depending on the page number

## Contribution
If you have any suggestions to improve this app, please reach out to me on github
